Hello everyone, below I will present what will be the first articles and projects that I want to focus on when starting this new adventure writing my own blog.

To make our first contact as "painless" as possible, I've made the decision that the first tool I'd like to introduce you to is [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). After finishing this series of articles, you will be able to generate your own project and environment variables, launch it from a Node.js application with [Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman), and integrate it into a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image.

The following topics will be covered:
  - Introduction to **Postman**.
  - Using Postman on our API.
  - Work with **GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE** requests.
  - Parameterization of variables.
  - Writing our first tests.
    - Validate answers.
    - Write assertions.
    - Format data output.
    - Tricks and tips.
  - Use of Newman from the command line terminal.
  - Integration of our collection with **Node.js** and **Newman**.
  - **Extra**: Integration of our Node.js project with **Docker**.

At the end of the entire tutorial, and the associated projects, you will have a good base to carry out your tests and their automation.

As in this project we are focusing on the backend of our application, the next natural step would be to carry out tests on the front end, so during the publication I will inform you of the next one to be carried out.
