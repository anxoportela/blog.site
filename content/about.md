After more than 15 years working as a Systems and Network Administrator, taking care of its design, assembly, deployment and maintenance, I made the decision in 2017 that the time had come to retrain and focus my career on development and programming.

With the knowledge acquired during my working life, and with a lot of effort and desire, I was able to successfully complete a double grade of _**Microcomputer Systems and Networks**_ and _**Web Application Development**_ at the [CIFP A Carballeira - Marcos Valc√°rcel](https://cifpacarballeira.gal/) center. During my training, I strengthened many concepts that I had already acquired, I specialized in Java programming, and I acquired extensive knowledge in developing client-type applications with JS and jQuery.

At the end of my official studies, before rejoining the labor market, I took specialization courses on the most used technologies in the sector, at that moment in time, and some courses for simple personal interest, which I list below:

 - Expert in prototyping with 4.0 tools: robotic, electronic and microcomputer projects
 - Responsive Web Design Course
 - HTML5 and CSS3 course
 - CSS web layout course
 - JavaScript course for beginners
 - Asynchronous programming with promises in JavaScript
 - Sass Course
 - Angular 8 course for beginners
 - Vue.js Course
 - Spring Boot and Spring MVC course

When the time came to start my new adventure, I was offered to automate functional tests for the financial sector, something that at that time I had no idea what it was, since I was only familiar with unit tests, but I was offered the opportunity to program in Java, in addition to training in the use of a completely new application stack. Being a person who came from the world of systems, in which by nature we are more curious and less afraid of "breaking" things, I accepted the challenge, and after more than 2 years, I can affirm that even lacking a time machine to knowing what would have happened if I had chosen another path, I do not regret the decision I made.

During this time I dedicated myself to the development of automations for web front end, mobile applications and their associated services for clients in the financial, management and air transport sectors, using a stack of applications (free and proprietary) adapted to the needs of the client, and at the same time time I was developing applications and scripts to make life easier for functional testers. Some of which are:

 - Selenium
 - Appium
 - Gherkin/Cucumber
 - Postman
 - Jmeter
 - Robot Framework
 - SoapUI

Coming to the end of 2022, I started this small blog/portfolio project, to practice my written English and driven by my interest in using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and integrating it into a pipeline of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), in which I will tell a little about my day to day, I will share tutorials, tips and tricks that have been useful to me during my career and articles with information of interest, with the desire to form a community to support each other.
